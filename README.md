Abstract: 
This paper builds a model describing vaccination dynamics in which the agents get heterogeneous information. 
There is a hidden state of the world indicating the effectiveness of the vaccine. 
Each agent’s preferences include the herd immunity, the vaccination cost and the component responsible for the pressure of social norms. 
At the start of the game, everyone gets the private signal that is correlated with the state, and then each agent decides on the timing of the vaccination decision.
Several results are established.
First, when the degree of social pressure and the vaccination cost increases, the society with more dispersed beliefs (greater variance of the private signals) tends to achieve higher vaccination rates. 
Second, when the population size grows very large, social learning induces everyone to quickly coordinate on the same action, thereby boosting the speed of vaccination.
Third, the possibility of learning from others’ actions may increase the peak accumulated vaccination rate by synchronizing the agents’ beliefs.
Several policy implications suggested by the model include the reduction in vaccination costs and information campaigns raising the precision of the public information. 
These insights are demonstrated via simulations.
